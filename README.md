# Serverless-hackathon

## Goal
If more than a handful of Functions have to be deployed, we want to find out how it can actually be deployed in a meaningful way. We want to determine the maturity level between 3 cloud providers in terms of flexibility, simplicity and automation.

## Orga
We form 3 group and each group focus on one provider. Then we compare the results.
As soon as participants have found each other, we start making appointments and builing groups etc. We can also mix remotely and on site, depending on who participates. The group-appointments can be an different days. Of course, pizza and beer are still welcome 

## Outcome
I'm sure, we can do something with the results. there are a few options 

## Preparation
* we need access for AWS, Azure, GCP	
* Definition of requirements, e.g. 10 functions that should have an independent lifecycle, but can be controlled together etc.
